    <p>We have reality, however it is: and we quantify it, measure it, give it form. This can be represented by drawing a circle on the infinite canvas of realspace that represents our system.</p>
    <img src = "images/Screenshot 2025-12-13 114129.png" alt="Circle on a black background" width="900"/>
    <p>Soon enough, we add another system, then another, then another, till the whole is filled with circles abounding.</p>

    <p>And so, it becomes better to move information between systems rather than just within them.</p>

    <h2 class = "so"><a href="../final/Game.html">Fun Breathing Simulator</a></h2>
    <div class="ex">
    <p>We can liken the function of a system to our breathing process. An important function of our breathing is that breathing in and breathing out cause fundamentally different air distributions, so they look completely different when you time reverse. The circles are like our mouths: they enforce a non-reversible cycle that brings in more information from reality. On the other hand, the arrows can have a tube construction that perfectly preserves the information flow with no loss in a time-reversible manner.</p>
    <p> These are the steps to the process of creating this arrow between the two systems:
        <ol><li>Map</li>
        <ul><li>Identify the key elements of both sytems</li><li>Determine rules for converting individual elements back and forth</li></ul>
        <li>Standardize</li>
        <ul><li>Test scenarios where either system shifts or expands</li><li>Continue to apply this process until you have achieved the desired scope</li></ul>
        <li>Streamline</li>
        <ul><li>Consider the speed and resource usage of the process</li><li>Create repeatable and fundamental categorizations of the process steps</li></ul>
    </ol></p>
    <p>This brings us to the concept that just like containerization revolutionized shipping physical wares, so too could some advanced technique revolutionize information flow.</p>
